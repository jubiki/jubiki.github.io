        <h3 id="general">General Information</h3>
        <p>We <i>always</i> conduct research before diving into the design process. First, we must understand your audience and read a sample of your manuscript ourselves. Second, we research popular trends within your genre. <b>You will not recieve a book cover in a few days.</b></p>
        <p>We'll need to know what size your printed book will be.</p>
        <p>Turn around for book covers can vary. Some styles are quicker to complete than others. Your completed package will include a PDF file, image file, and editable AI or PSD file.</p>
        <p>We <b>do not</b> print books or provide you with an ISBN. We design book covers only.</p>
        <h3 id="full">Full Book Cover (Front, Back and Spine)</h3>
        <p>We need a final page count and book size to calculate spine width. We cannot proceed without that information.</p>
