        <p>You have a passion that you love. You want to make it a career, but the work involved is overwhelming. You need help, and you don't know where to turn to. Does that sound like you?</p> 
        <p>We help creative people build a life worth living by helping them turn their passion into a business. We outline the problems, build solutions and help them (re)launch. Even if you don't have a clear goal, we can help you sort out your most pressing problems.</p>
        <h2>Build a Life Worth Living</h2>
        <p>If you can't imagine working your career for twenty or more years, you're in the wrong career field. We can help you build a life worth living by turning your passion into a career. We've helped many people do it, so step up and ask us how it can happen for you.</p> 
        <h2>Giving Back</h2>
