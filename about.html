        <p>We are Jubiki Studios, a small business based in New Orleans, LA. We focus on making creative professionals look good in print and on the web. We're operated by a team of experienced creative professionals. After struggling to find services that fit our needs, we decided to launch a business to provide the services that we, ourselves, struggled to find.</p>

        <p>We've carefully constructed graphic, print and web services designed specifically for creative professionals like actors, models, authors, and artists. Being creative professionals ourselves, we built a company with services geared to solve the problems we experienced firsthand.</p>
        <p>Our products include, yet aren't limited to, comp cards, headshots, business cards, posters, banners, and more. We design and develop professional websites, too.</p>
