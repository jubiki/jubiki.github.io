        <h3 id="basic-website">Basic Website</h3>
        <p>A <i>basic</i> website has between two and six pages that presents information about a person, group or organization. (A brochure style site, if you will.) It's great for people that have no time for blogging and may only update their site a few times a month (if that).</p>
        <p>A basic website gives you everything you need without bloat or trapping you in a cookie-cutter design. Our price range for a basic site is &#36;200 to &#36;500. Every basic website comes with the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple CSS3 Animations</li>
            <li>Simple Javascript/JQuery (ex: image gallery, sliders...etc)</li>
            <li>Custom Fonts</li>
            <li>Contact Form (if applicable)</li>
            <li>AI or PSD file of your web design</li>
            <li>Custom Icons (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Free setup on hosting of your choice</li>
            <li>Website files with comments</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You'll have a user friendly dashboard to update your website. There's no complicated updates or security settings to figure out. We do that for you on setup.</p>
        <h3 id="maintenance">Web Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Some people have no interest in maintaining or updating their websites. For those people, we offer a maintenance plan at <b>&#36;50 a month</b>.</p>
        <p>Everything will be done for you. If there is a problem with either your hosting or web domain, we will handle it. If your code needs maintenance or you want to update your content, we will handle that on your behalf.</p>
        <h3>Blogs, Fan Sites and Other Things</h3>
        <p>We do work with different platforms to meet more robust needs. Wordpress is a popular option with clients. It's user friendly with a large supporting community.</p>
        <p>Typically, we go with what is best for the client. While many people would like a site on a popular CMS, not many actually use it frequently enough to warrant the cost of one. Unless you're going to update more than five times a month, we don't recommend a bulky solution like this.</p>
        <p>If you're set on one, though, our pricing for them is different:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th colspan="3" style="text-align: center;">Wordpress</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th width="20">#</th>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Pricing</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Customization</td>
                <td>$360</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Normal</td>
                <td>$500</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>E-Commerce</td>
                <td>$1200</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Posting regular events, sharing latest works and diligent blogging is made easier with Wordpress. If you actively promote yourself, this would be a better option to go with. Every Wordpress site will include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple CSS3 Animations</li>
            <li>Simple Javascript/JQuery (ex: image gallery, sliders...etc)</li>
            <li>Custom Fonts</li>
            <li>AI or PSD file of your web design</li>
            <li>6 Custom Icons</li>
            <li>Free setup on hosting of your choice</li>
            <li>Website files with comments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want us to customize a premium theme, we charge a flat rate of &#36;360. For rates working with a non-Wordpress platform, please drop us an email.</p>
